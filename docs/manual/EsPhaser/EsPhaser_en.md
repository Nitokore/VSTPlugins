EsPhaser requires CPU which supports AVX or later SIMD instructions.

The package includes following builds:

- Windows 64bit
- Linux 64bit
- macOS 64bit

macOS build isn't tested because I don't have Mac. If you found a bug, please file a issue to [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins) or send email to `ryukau@gmail.com`.

Linux build is built on Ubuntu 18.0.4 and tested on Bitwig and Reaper. If you are using distribution other than Ubuntu 18.04, plugin will not likely run. In this case, please take a look at [build instruction](https://github.com/ryukau/VSTPlugins/blob/master/build_instruction.md).

## Installation
### Plugin
Place `*.vst3` directory to:

- `/Program Files/Common Files/VST3/` for Windows.
- `$HOME/.vst3/` for Linux.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Plug-ins/VST3/` for macOS.

DAW may provides additional VST3 directory. For more information, please refer to the manual of the DAW.

### Presets
Extract preset zip, then place preset directory to the OS specific path:

- Windows : `/Users/$USERNAME/Documents/VST3 Presets/Uhhyou`
- Linux : `$HOME/.vst3/presets/Uhhyou`
- macOS : `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Audio/Presets/Uhhyou`

Preset directory name must be the same as the plugin. Make `Uhhyou` directory if it does not exist.

### Windows Specific
If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, try installing C++ redistributable (`vc_redist.x64.exe`). Installer can be found in the link below.

- [The latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

### Linux Specific
On Ubuntu 18.0.4, those packages are required.

```bash
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0  libxkbcommon-x11-0
```

If DAW doesn't recognize the plugin, take a look at `Package Requirements` section of the link below and make sure all the VST3 related package is installed.

- [VST 3 Interfaces: Setup Linux for building VST 3 Plug-ins](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_doc/vstinterfaces/linuxSetup.html)

REAPER on Linux may not recognize the plugin. A workaround is to delete a file `~/.config/REAPER/reaper-vstplugins64.ini` and restart REAPER.

### macOS Specific
When trying to run plugin first time, following message may appear on macOS.

```
<PluginName>.vst3 is damaged and can't be opened. You should move it to
the Trash"
```

In this case, open terminal and try running following command to unzipped `.vst3` directory.

```sh
xattr -rc /path/to/PluginName.vst3
```

Plugin may be considered as unsigned/un-notarized application. In this case, try following the steps below.

1. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-disable`.
2. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select "Anywhere".

Beware that steps above degrades security of your system. To revert the settings, follow the steps below.

1. Go to System Preferences → Security and Privacy → General → Allow apps downloaded from, then select option to "App Store and identified developers".
2. Open terminal and run `sudo spctl --master-enable`.

## Color Configuration
At first time, create color config file to:

- `/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Windows.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on Linux.
  - If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is empty, make `$HOME/.config/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json`.
- `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Preferences/UhhyouPlugins/style/style.json` on macOS.

Below is a example of `style.json`.

```json
{
  "fontPath": "",
  "foreground": "#000000",
  "foregroundButtonOn": "#000000",
  "foregroundInactive": "#8a8a8a",
  "background": "#ffffff",
  "boxBackground": "#ffffff",
  "border": "#000000",
  "borderCheckbox": "#000000",
  "borderLabel": "#000000",
  "unfocused": "#dddddd",
  "highlightMain": "#0ba4f1",
  "highlightAccent": "#13c136",
  "highlightButton": "#fcc04f",
  "highlightWarning": "#fc8080",
  "overlay": "#00000088",
  "overlayHighlight": "#00ff0033"
}
```

Hex color codes are used.

- 6 digit color is RGB.
- 8 digit color is RGBA.

First letter `#` is conventional. Plugins ignore the first letter of color code, thus `?102938`, `\n11335577` are valid.

Do not use characters outside of `0-9a-f` for color value.

- `fontPath`: Absolute path to *.ttf font file. Not implemented in VST 3 version.
- `foreground`: Text color.
- `foregroundButtonOn`: Text color of active toggle button. Recommend to use the same value of `foreground` or `boxBackground`.
- `foregroundInactive`: Text color of inactive components. Currently, only used for TabView.
- `background`: Background color.
- `boxBackground`: Background color of inside of box shaped components (Barbox, Button, Checkbox, OptionMenu, TextKnob, VSlider).
- `border`: Border color of box shaped components.
- `borderCheckbox`: Border color of CheckBox.
- `borderLabel`: Line color of parameter section label.
- `unfocused`: Color to fill unfocused components. Currently, only used for knobs.
- `highlightMain`: Color to indicate focus is on a component. Highlight colors are also used for value of slider components (BarBox and VSlider).
- `highlightAccent`: Same as `highlightMain`. Used for cosmetics.
- `highlightButton`: Color to indicate focus is on a button.
- `highlightWarning`: Same as `highlightMain`, but only used for parameters which requires extra caution.
- `overlay`: Overlay color. Used to overlay texts and indicators.
- `overlayHighlight`: Overlay color to highlight current focus.

## Controls
Knob and number slider can do:

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kdb>Left Click</kbd>: Reset value.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd>: Fine adjustment.

## Caution
When stage is set to 4096, it will be CPU intensive.

Output varies in different sample rate.

Output may be loud when changing Cas. Offset. Use  <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Left Drag</kbd> to slowly change the value, or insert limiter to prevent hard clipping.

## Block Diagram
If the image is small, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Mouse Wheel</kbd> or "View Image" on right click menu to scale.

Diagram only shows overview. It's not exact implementation.

## Parameters
Stages

:   Number of all-pass filter.

Mix

:   Mixing ratio of dry/wet signal of phaser. `Dry : Wet` becomes `0 : 1` when turned the knob to rightmost.

Freq

:   LFO frequency.

Spread

:   Spread frequency between LFOs.

    Equation for difference of LFO phase in 1 sample:

    ```
    deltaPhase = 2 * pi * Freq / ((1 + LfoIndex * Spread) * sampleRate)
    ```

Feedback

:   Amount of feedback. Feedback is disabled when the knob is pointing to 12 o'clock. It becomes negative feedback when turned to left and positive feedback when turned to right.

Range

:   Range of all-pass filter modulation by LFO.

Min

:   Minimum value of all-pass filter modulation by LFO.

Cas. Offset

:   Phase offset between 16 LFO.

L/R Offset

:   LFO phase offset between L/R channels.

Phase

:   LFO phase. This can be used to make sound with automation. Turning `Freq` to leftmost sets LFO frequency to 0.

    Equation for phase offset:

    ```
    LfoPhaseOffset = Phase + (L/R Offset) + LfoIndex * (Cas. Offset)
    ```
